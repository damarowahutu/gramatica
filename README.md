# Grammar of the Xavante indigenous language

This project aims to document the grammar of the Xavante language. It will be useful to preserve the language. It will also help that other people can learn and communicate using this native language from Brazil.
Those interested in learning the language can use the [Study Guide](https://edurbs.github.io/xavante/gram%C3%A1tica/guia%20de%20estudos/) to study in a more didactic way.
If you need any help you can create a new [issue](https://github.com/edurbs/edurbs.github.io/issues).
If you want to contribute to the project, you can make a pull request.
